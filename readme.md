# Status Quo - Print styles and limitations

## Header and Footer

Best possible way seems to be to have an [absolute](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21043407/778340) (or fixed?) element on print mode?

Also interesting SO thread about headers [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19646835/print-repeating-page-headers-in-chrome/25880258#25880258).

And as an answer to this SO thread:

### CSS Paged Media Module Level 3 Spec

In the [CSS Paged Media Module Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page/) combined [CSS GCPM 3 spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-gcpm/) there is the possibility to define a DOM target that acts as a footer or header in the printed page.

There are tools like [PrinceXML](https://www.princexml.com/), [AntennaHouse](https://www.antennahouse.com/formatter-v7) or [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/) that support this spec!

An interesting article about possibilities can be found on [AListApart](https://alistapart.com/article/boom/).

Unfortunately there is no browser support yet:

- [Chromium](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=47277)
